# CVMC-OmniAV

We aim to build a large-scale and universal video dataset to support a range of research in audio-visual learning. 

### The following tasks will be supported:

Self-supervised audio-visual representation learning, sounding object localization and segmentation, audio-visual event localization, audio-visual video parsing, audio-visual question answering, and audio-visual sound separation.
